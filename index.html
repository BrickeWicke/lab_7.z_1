                <h1>Agera R</h1>
                <span>The Koenigsegg Agera is the result of the evolution of the previous Koenigsegg CC model, testifying to the effectiveness of the supercar concept chosen by Chrisian von Koenigsegg, which has not lost its relevance over time. It is no coincidence that the verb "Agera" is translated from Swedish as "to act", and in Greek "Ageratos" means "ageless". The Koenigsegg Agera raised the bar for hypercar dynamic performance to a new level: its estimated top speed was 420 km/h, and acceleration to 96 km/h took just 2.9 seconds. This means that the Koenigsegg Agera could beat the Bugatti Veyron, which once broke the speed record set by the Koenigsegg CCR. Naturally, the price of the car also rose to a new level - $1.2 million.</span>

                <h1>One:1</h1>
                <span>The world's first megacar. The characteristics of this car are a level higher than those of the Koenigsegg Agera hypercar, on the basis of which it was built. The prefix "mega" indicates that the power of the 5-liter twin-turbo V8 engine, running on ethanol or gasoline, has been increased to 1,361 hp, or one megawatt. In addition, the company's engineers managed to achieve an equal ratio of power (1361 hp) to vehicle weight (1361 kg), which is reflected in the name - One:1. It was the result of a major overhaul of the Koenigsegg Agera's design to make it as lightweight as possible. Many of the metal elements of the monocoque were replaced with composite or titanium ones, even the suspension received carbon springs. The wheels are also 40% lighter than steel, made entirely of carbon fiber with hollow spokes. To increase downforce, the Koenigsegg One:1 was equipped with a huge adjustable wing, which also acts as an airbrake. For better cooling of the engine compartment, we had to sacrifice a removable roof and rear window, which was replaced by a central air intake.</span>

                <h1>Regera</h1>
                <span>The model inherits only the Agera's 5-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine, which itself develops an incredible 1,115 hp. However, in the Regera it has no direct mechanical connection to the driven rear axle. Instead of a traditional transmission, the innovative Koenigsegg Direct Drive (KDD) system with a 2.73:1 gear ratio is used in combination with three YASA electric motors. One of them, with a power of 215 hp, is located on the output shaft of the gasoline internal combustion engine and simultaneously acts as a starter and generator. Two more electric motors with 245 hp each. each is mounted directly on the rear axle and rotates the wheels. A 620-volt Rimac battery with a range of 35 km is mounted in the central tunnel of the monocoque. It can be infected either from the V8 engine or from the socket through the hole under the rear license plate. At speeds up to 50 km/h and in reverse, the car runs on electric power alone, but when all three motors are connected, the combined power reaches 1,500 hp.</span>

                <h1>Jesko</h1>
                <span>The Koenigsegg Jesko is a hypercar named by Christian von Koenigsegg in honor of his 80-year-old father Jesko. Presented at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show, it replaces the Agera and is being produced in 2020 alongside the hybrid Regera. The show example surprised the public with a large carbon fiber front splitter and a huge boomerang-shaped rear wing suspended on two horizontal supports. Together they provide 1,000 kg of downforce at 275 km/h and 1,700 kg at a top speed that is not yet known. The company has also developed a modification of the Jesko Absolut with less downforce and reduced aerodynamic drag, capable of accelerating to 483 km/h (300 mph) and above. Both versions are certified for use on public roads around the world. In total, the company will build 125 copies of the Koenigsegg Jesko worth $3 million each.</span>

                <h1>Gemera</h1>
                <span>The Koenigsegg Gemera is incredibly spacious thanks to a 3-meter wheelbase and a compact power module located above the rear axle. Instead of a traditional gasoline V8, it uses a unique 2.0-liter Tiny Friendly Giant (TFG) inline 3-cylinder engine, weighing just 70 kg, capable of running on Gen 2.0 clean ethanol, Vulcanol methanol, E85 ethanol or, in the worst case, regular gasoline. The engine is equipped with a Freevalve individual valve actuation system, which eliminates the need for camshafts, as well as two sequentially connected turbochargers, a system for warming up the intake manifold before starting at low temperatures and a dry sump lubrication system. The TFG itself produces 600 hp. and 600 Nm, while its average fuel consumption is 7.1 l/100 km. However, the internal combustion engine plays only a supporting role, connecting during acceleration and to charge the battery.</span>
